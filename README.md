This Python program performs punching shear verification and resistance calculation of flat (mushroom) slabs according to mettoni method



Main features include:

🧮 Automated calculations of punching stresses around column supports (circular or rectangular) ;
📊 Graphical visualization of punching zones, reinforcement layouts, and shear forces ;
✅ Color-coded design reports (green for safe, yellow for warning, red for failure) ;
💾 Automatic PDF report generation including results, diagrams, and reinforcement layouts ;
🎨 A modern and user-friendly graphical interface designed for civil engineers, students, and educators.



This project is part of the Hermann Engineering initiative, focused on civil engineering education and Python-based structural analysis tools.




Main technologies: Python, Tkinter, Matplotlib, NumPy, ReportLab.
